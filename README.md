### **Key Features**

This bot has been revamped from the ground up to be a robust and intelligent automation tool.

* **Multi-Account Support:** Run an unlimited number of accounts by simply adding their private keys to a text file.
* **Proxy Rotation:** Automatically assigns a different proxy from your list to each account to reduce the risk of IP-based tracking.
* **Intelligent Run Modes:** Choose to run the bot once for all accounts or set it to run on a continuous, automated schedule every 24-26 hours.
* **Graceful Error Handling:** A failure on one account (e.g., invalid private key, insufficient funds) will not crash the bot. It logs the error and automatically moves on to the next account.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, simple command-line interface with colored logs makes it easy to track the bot's progress.
